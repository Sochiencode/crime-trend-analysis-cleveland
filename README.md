## 🔥 Interactive Crime Hotspot Map

👉 **Live map:**  
https://sochiencode.github.io/crime-trend-analysis-cleveland/

The map visualises spatial concentrations of recorded crime in Cleveland (UK)
using kernel density estimation (KDE) and open police data.

## Key Analyses

### 1. Temporal Crime Trends
- Monthly aggregation of reported crimes
- Identification of seasonal and long-term trends
- Comparison across crime categories

📈 *Example output:*  
![Monthly Crime Trends](assets/monthly_trends.png)

---

### 2. Crime Type Distribution
- Frequency analysis of reported crime types
- Identification of dominant offences across the period
- Comparison of variability between crime categories

---

### 3. Spatial Analysis
- Geographic plotting using latitude and longitude
- Marker clustering to identify crime hotspots
- Visual separation of dense vs low-frequency areas


---

### 4. Power BI Dashboard
An interactive dashboard was created to allow:
- Time-based filtering using a date slicer
- Crime type filtering
- Dynamic map and trend updates

The dashboard enables **non-technical users** to explore crime patterns without interacting with code.

---

## Key Insights (Summary)
- Certain crime categories consistently dominate monthly totals
- Clear temporal patterns are observable across the period
- Crime incidents show strong spatial clustering in specific urban areas
- Interactive visualisation significantly improves insight accessibility

*(Detailed insights are documented within the notebook and dashboard.)*

---

## Limitations
- Analysis is limited to reported crimes only
- No demographic or socioeconomic variables included
- Spatial accuracy depends on available coordinate precision
- Forecasting beyond short-term horizons was not included

---

## Future Improvements
- Add short-term crime forecasting models
- Introduce intervention scenario modelling (e.g. patrol increases)
- Enrich data with population or deprivation indices
- Publish dashboard to Power BI Service for public access
